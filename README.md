# Village NIRD Door

Immersive Babylon.js vignette inspired by the "Door of Steam" art direction. Now it’s an arcade-style quiz: two luminous doors display answer choices and you must pick the one that aligns with the NIRD mindset. Correct doors swing wide open onto the resilient village while the HUD updates progress, score, and narrative feedback.

## Stack

- Vite + TypeScript
- Babylon.js for the 3D scene and glow effects
- Vanilla CSS HUD layered on top of the canvas

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Controls

- Drag with the mouse/touchpad to orbit the camera.
- Hover the doors to read each option, then click the door you want to open.
- Use the `Question suivante` / `Voir les résultats` button in the HUD after each decision.

At the end you can replay instantly to aim for a perfect score.

Everything ships under an MIT-friendly setup; replace copy or styling as needed for the final Nuit de l'Info submission.
