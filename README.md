# Village NIRD Door

Immersive Babylon.js vignette inspired by the "Door of Steam" art direction. The scene contrasts a closed Big Tech stack with a resilient NIRD village. Tapping the shimmering doorway or using the HUD buttons toggles between the two moods while live gauges show sobriety, inclusion, and autonomy.

## Stack

- Vite + TypeScript
- Babylon.js for the 3D scene and glow effects
- Vanilla CSS HUD layered on top of the canvas

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Controls

- Drag with the mouse/touchpad to orbit the camera.
- Click (or tap) the portal plane or the HUD buttons to flip between moods.
- Watch the HUD copy and gauges update to understand the narrative contrast.

Everything ships under an MIT-friendly setup; replace copy or styling as needed for the final Nuit de l'Info submission.
